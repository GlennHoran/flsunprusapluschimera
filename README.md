# flsunprusapluschimera
My config files for marlin (I think 1.7) for an Flsun prusa plus (300mm buildplate) using an inductive sensor and a chimera clone dual extruder

Warning: I highly recommend only using this config as a guide. It works with my setup (see below). I am not responsible to any damaged caused to your printer by using this configuration. 

My setup is the stock set up using the chimera hotend and this carriage mount https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2847458.
You will need to adjust the z offset for the sensor to work correctly and avoid your y carriage potentially crashing into the build surface.
